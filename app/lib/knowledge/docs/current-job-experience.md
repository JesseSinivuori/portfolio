Jesse has 2+ years of professional software engineering experience, shipping production features continuously across frontend and backend.
In addition, he spent about one year building and shipping portfolio projects full time, bringing total hands-on development experience to 3+ years.

His frontend focus includes React and Next.js (including Server Components), with experience building reusable UI components, form-heavy flows, and data-table interfaces.

He has worked with shadcn-based component patterns and production UX concerns such as validation, state handling, and reliable interaction flows.
He is familiar with Storybook and knows the basics of using it for UI component documentation.

On backend systems, he works with NestJS/Node APIs and integration surfaces, including OpenAPI-driven contracts, schema validation with Zod, and feature delivery that spans API + UI boundaries.

He has implemented and maintained authentication/authorization layers, including RBAC and multi-tenant access patterns.
He has shipped features in multi-tenant SaaS product environments.

Overall, he is comfortable owning full-stack scope and shipping user-facing outcomes quickly without sacrificing maintainability.

Alongside product work, he consistently builds personal side projects, including algorithmic trading strategy tooling and an AI website generator.

He is highly experienced with AI-assisted development workflows and building AI-enabled features with Vercel AI SDK.
He is familiar with LLM integrations in product features, including streaming chat-style experiences and prompt/response flows.
He is familiar with RAG-style retrieval patterns where relevant context is retrieved before response generation.
He is also familiar with LLM context-management patterns such as message pruning and controlled context windows to maintain response quality and cost.
He has optimized LLM token usage in personal projects through prompt design, context pruning, and response-budget controls.
He is comfortable building agent-style AI workflows like this portfolio assistant, including tool use, retrieval, and response orchestration.

In 2025 alone, he used over 1 billion AI tokens in real development workflows.

He uses tools like Cursor, Claude Code, Codex, and CLI-based automation daily, and builds reusable AI skills for tasks like code review and scripting workflows to improve speed and quality.
